# Linked List CPP
 Codes ,problems and solution regarding linked lists
 this is my first attempt on making a repository for providing solutions for basic data structers starting from linked lists.
 this file as of now contains basic data structure code of a simple linked list with operations :
 
 1. add at beginning
 2. remove at end,add at the end
 3. remove at the beginning
 4. insert at a specific position
 5. remove from a specific position
 6. search for a specific value
 7. display the list

 also i the program has a user driver menu.
 looking forward to more information on linked list and other data structures.
